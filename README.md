Marlin Tevo Tarantula standard bed no auto level

I found that all the firmware on the community Facebook page did not work with my standard bed, no auto level Tevo Tarantula (TT). Therefore I took the Marlin firmware and educated myself with the Interwebs and YouTube and build my own firmware.

This is the result.

Please understand that you need to do some adjustments yourself in order to make it just perfect for your TT. But by default it should work just fine (if your Y-stepper motor is on the left when you look from the front of your TT) on the MKS MakerBase 1.3/1.4 motherboard.

Good luck!
